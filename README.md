# unit test with Jest 
_This is a project taken from the "JavaScript Testing with Jest Course" taught at Platzi, in which, hoping it helps, I reflect what I learned._

## Steps

* Clone the repository
* Run the command "npm Intall" to dowload the dependecies.
* Run the command "npm run test" to execute all unit test.
* Run the command "test:coverage" to execute coverage.
